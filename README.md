       creation of monty interpreter with C language using 
       doubly linked list and stacks/queues, the programe can
       do stack's operations and manipulation instead of calculations.

       compiled by : gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

       Usage: after compilation and run (./monty) tested by bytecodes with commandes like this: ./monty bytecodes/00.m

       This programe help us to undrstand:
        * What do LIFO and FIFO mean
        * What is a stack, and when to use it
        * What is a queue, and when to use it
        * What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
        * What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
        * What is the proper way to use global variables
